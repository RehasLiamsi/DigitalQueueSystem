# Digital Queue System

This project is a **Queue Management System** designed to streamline the process of handling customer queues. It allows users to join a queue via a QR code scan or clicking on a link and view their current position in the queue. The system updates queue positions in real-time and provides an option for users to leave the queue. Moreover, it gives the admin the power to control the queues in real time, like activating a queue or closing it down.
